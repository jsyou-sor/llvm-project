- $ make test (to apply both IR and backend passes)
- TODO
  => need to change helper functions (i.e. emitAddSub, emitAddSub_rr, emitAddSub_rx, emitAddSub_rs)
     to transfer metadata in PARTS-style
  => too many calls to helper functions to update all of them
  => just make 'emitAdd' used helper functions

04/06/2021
- DONE
  => able to cross-compile spec2006 for arm64 using clang
  => integration of IR + backend pass on default clang
- TODO
  => check whether compiled spec2006 executable runs on ORDROID board
  => implement other functions called within AArch64FastISel::selectGetElementPtr
     [e.g.] fastEmit_rr, etc.
  => need to implement functions for every path taken to emit GEP instruction

04/09/2021
- DONE
  => found register offset LDR insts.
  => move utility functions for cleanup
  => checkout every functions taken from selectGetElementPtr
- TODO
  => check on OrdroidC4 board (spec2006 executable)
  => study LDR (register offset) extend, amount (UXTW, LSL, SXTW, SXTX) + opcode when its used

04/10/2021
- DONE
  => insert corresponding instructions for register offset LDRs
  => insert corresponding instructions for register offset STRs
- TODO
  => check correct execution when original inst. are removed
  => check inserted instructions' results are the same compared to original insts.
  => check whether there are other instructions postfixed with "roX"
  => same for STRs
