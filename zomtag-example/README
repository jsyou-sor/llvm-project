- $ make test (to apply both IR and backend passes)
- TODO
  => need to change helper functions (i.e. emitAddSub, emitAddSub_rr, emitAddSub_rx, emitAddSub_rs)
     to transfer metadata in PARTS-style
  => too many calls to helper functions to update all of them
  => just make 'emitAdd' used helper functions

- DONE
  => able to cross-compile spec2006 for arm64 using clang
  => integration of IR + backend pass on default clang
- TODO
  => check whether compiled spec2006 executable runs on ORDROID board
  => implement other functions called within AArch64FastISel::selectGetElementPtr
     [e.g.] fastEmit_rr, etc.
  => need to implement functions for every path taken to emit GEP instruction
