- $ make test (to apply both IR and backend passes)
- TODO
  => need to change helper functions (i.e. emitAddSub, emitAddSub_rr, emitAddSub_rx, emitAddSub_rs)
     to transfer metadata in PARTS-style
  => too many calls to helper functions to update all of them
  => just make 'emitAdd' used helper functions
